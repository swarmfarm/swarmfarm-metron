# Metron

_Geometry, simplified._

Metron is a comprehensive collection of geometric functions and types that extend the 2D geometric primitives provided by CoreGraphics. Completely written in Swift, Metron allows you to express complex geometric calculations in very intuitive statements:

**Example 1.**

```swift
Circle(in: viewFrame).contains(touchPoint)
```
‚Ü≥ creates a `Circle` that fits (centered) inside `viewFrame`, and checks if the `touchPoint` is inside that circle.

**Example 2.**

```swift
(Angle(.pi) + Angle(270, unit: .degrees)).normalized // Angle of 0.5pi (90¬∞)
```
‚Ü≥ adds two `Angles`, one expressed in radians (default) and one in degrees. The sum is normalized to within 0 and 2ùõë radians *(or 0 and 360 degrees)*.

**Example 3.**

```swift
LineSegment(a: startPoint, b: currentPoint).intersection(with: viewFrame.lineSegment(for: minYEdge))
```
‚Ü≥ creates a `LineSegment` between a (touch) start point and current point, and returns the intersection with the `minYEdge` of a view's frame (if these line segments indeed intersect).

**Example 4.**

```swift
let rotatedPoints = viewFrame.points.map { $0.applying(rotationTransform, anchorPoint: rotationPoint) }
let path: CGPath = Polygon(points: rotatedPoints).path
```
‚Ü≥ maps each corner point of a view's frame (a `CGRect`) to a point to which a `rotationTransform` is applied, taking `rotationPoint` as the anchor point for the transform.
With these points, a `Polygon` is initialized, representing the rotated rectangular frame of the view. From that polygon, we derive a `CGPath` that can then be drawn.
